<h1>Hands-on negotiation coaching to get you a higher salary. That's it.</h1>

<p>I'm not trying to collect your personal information, sell you an online course, or market artisanal coffee. Instead, I'll provide you with strategies and tactics to get an increase in compensation during your most recent job search or in your current role.</p>

<p>Whether you're starting your first job right out of school or have been working for ten years, we will work together to identify what your objectives are, and practice using psychological tools you can use to get what you want. If you're interested, read through how my coaching has helped some folks:

<div><div class="circle" style="background:blue;">SM</div>"Kevin and I went back and forth for about two days and eventually negotiated a 40% total compensation increase from my previous position."</div>
<div><div class="circle" style="background:green;">TK</div>"Kevin helped me review a prospective job offer and come up with a template to counter the offer. He provided communication strategies targeted to increase the starting salary, bonus, and stock with the recruiter. Ultimately, Kevin provided me with the tools to negotiate and secure a 7% increase in total compensation."</div>


</p>

<p>I can't help you get a job, but I can help you get more money when you are about to start. And if you aren't able to negotiate a higher salary, I don't get paid. I have a fixed fee scale, based on how much we win for you.</p>
